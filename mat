	Create a row vector in which the first element is 1, the last element is 33, with an increment of 2 
     	between the elements.
		A = [1:2:33]
		A = [15:-5:-25]
		transpose(A)

	. Create a vector, name it Afirst,  that has 16 elements in which the first is 4, the increment is 3 and 
   	 the last element is 49. Then, using the colon symbol, create a new vector , call it Asecond, that 
   	 has eight elements. The first four elements are the first four elements of the vector Afirst, and the  
   	 last four are the last four elements of the vector Afirst. 

		Asecond = [A(1:4) A(13:16)]
